# tf

Terraform (standalone) files for small quick utility deployments;
generally consisting of single VMs with remote access (SSH, RDP) configured.

## Example: Azure - ubuntu_on_azure.tf

Deploys a single Ubuntu VM on Azure, with ssh login (port:80, public ip) open.
To restrict access to just the public IP (host) where you are running terraform from,
you can set the IP via:

```shell
 export TF_VAR_source_address_prefix=`curl 'https://api.ipify.org?format=text'
```
